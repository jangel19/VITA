# VITA Health

VITA Health is a wearable health-tech platform currently under development, designed to track real-time biometrics such as heart rate, SpO2, motion, and temperature. The system combines embedded IoT hardware (ESP32 microcontroller + sensors) with a mobile app interface, aiming to deliver accurate, privacy-focused health monitoring.

## Status: In Progress

### Project Overview

- The initial version of the VITA app was developed in **Swift** for iOS devices.
- We are currently **migrating the UI to React Native** to optimize performance, scalability, and compatibility across both **Android and iOS** platforms.
- The goal is to create a fast, secure, and responsive cross-platform app with real-time data visualization and long-term health trend analytics.

### Hardware & Sensor Integration

We‚Äôre currently testing and validating sensor data accuracy and Bluetooth communication protocols.

#### What‚Äôs working:
- **ESP32 board** is successfully streaming data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- **Heart rate sensor (MAX30102)** is transmitting live pulse and SpO2 data
- **Accelerometer** and **gyroscope** are tracking motion events and orientation
- Basic connectivity and sensor logic is being prototyped in **Arduino IDE**

#### Ongoing Work:
- Calibrating sensor accuracy across different users and conditions
- Testing BLE connection stability and throughput
- Creating fallback mechanisms and alert logic for disconnected states
- Improving battery optimization and packaging for wearability

### UI Development (React Native)

The user interface is being rebuilt from the ground up to provide a clean, intuitive, and mobile-first experience. Planned features include:

- üìä Real-time health metrics dashboard
- üìà Historical data charting and analytics
- üõèÔ∏è Sleep, activity, and recovery tracking
- üîí Secure user authentication and device linking (via Supabase)

### Tech Stack

- `ESP32` (Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller)
- `Arduino IDE` (sensor development & testing)
- `MAX30102` (SpO2 + Heart Rate sensor)
- `Accelerometer` / `Gyroscope`
- `React Native` (upcoming UI framework)
- `Supabase` (user auth & cloud database)
- `Figma` (UI/UX wireframing)

---

### Timeline

This is an evolving project with many moving parts ‚Äî sensor firmware, BLE protocols, and UI logic are being tested and refined in parallel. Our goal is to have an MVP ready for demo in late 2025/early 2026.

---

### Team

VITA is developed by a team of six passionate student engineers with backgrounds in embedded systems, iOS development, UI/UX, and cloud architecture.

### Note

This is a work-in-progress repository. Some components and code will change drastically as we transition away from the original Swift-based app and toward a unified cross-platform codebase. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
